          "description":["The continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) is a widely used model for chemical reactors in environmental and chemical engineering. It is also known as a mixed flow reactor, backmix reactor, or a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CFSTR). The CSTR operates by continually stirring the contents of the reactor, which results in a perfectly mixed reagent that is uniformly mixed upon entry. This model assumes perfect mixing and is often approximated as an ideal CSTR. The ideal CSTR is the complete opposite of a plug flow reactor (PFR) and is the ideal limit of complete mixing in reactor design. However, in practice, no reactor behaves ideally and falls somewhere in between the mixing limits of an ideal CSTR and PFR.","The behavior of a CSTR is modeled based on several assumptions such as ideal mixing, steady-state, constant fluid density, nth-order reaction, isothermal conditions, closed boundaries, and single, irreversible reaction. Theoretical residence time is the total amount of time that a discrete quantity of reagent spends inside the reactor. The residence time is always equal to the reactor volume divided by the fluid flow rate for an ideal reactor. The reaction rate, rA, is generally dependent on the concentration of species A in the reactor and the rate constant, depending on the order of the reaction. The rate constant is determined using a known empirical reaction rate that is adjusted for temperature using the Arrhenius temperature dependence.","One of the characteristics of an ideal CSTR is that all fluid particles will spend the same amount of time within the reactor. However, this is not the case in practice, as not all fluid particles will spend the same amount of time within the reactor. The exit age distribution (E(t)) defines the probability that a given fluid particle will spend time t in the reactor. The cumulative age distribution (F(t)) gives the probability that a given fluid particle has an exit age less than time t. The exit age distribution is an important parameter that characterizes the behavior of the reactor, and it has applications in various industries such as the chemical and environmental engineering fields."],
